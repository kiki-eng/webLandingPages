          </h3>
          <p className="text-xl mb-3">
            My750HrsTracker is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
            and efficient as possible. Therefore, we reserve the right to make
            changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and
            for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
            without making it clear to you what you’re paying for.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl mb-3">
            The My750HrsTracker app stores and processes personal data that you
            have provided to us in order to provide the My750HrsTracker service.
            It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
            secure. We strongly recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
            phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
            Jailbreaking or rooting your phone could make it vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
            features, and could mean that the My750HrsTracker app may not work
            properly or at all.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl mb-3">
            My750HrsTracker cannot always take responsibility for how you use
            the app, for example, if your device runs out of battery and you
            cannot access the app, My750HrsTracker cannot accept responsibility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl mb-3">
            From time to time, we may wish to update the app. The app is
            available for Android and iOS, and the system requirements for the
            app may change. You will need to download the updates if you want to
            continue using the app. It is your responsibility to keep the app
            version up to date. My750HrsTracker does not guarantee that the app
            will always be updated to meet your needs or to work with the
            version of your mobile operating system. However, you agree to
            always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may
            also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use of the app
            at any time without giving notice of termination.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl mb-3">
            We strongly recommend that you only download the My750HrsTracker
            applications from official sources such as the Play Store or App
            Store. Doing so ensures that your apps are legitimate and safe from
            malicious software.
